Assignment 1
------------

There are two main parts to this assignment. First, when you open up the solution you should
see three projects: Problems, Tests, and TicTacToe. First, start in the Problems project.
There are two class files you need to pay attention to: Problem1.cs and Problem2.cs. 

The objective of the first part of the assignment is to make all tests pass. You can find the
tests in the Tests project, and you can find out how to run them here:

You should modify the code in the Problem1.cs file until all of the unit tests pass as described
in the above link. The comments in each method in the Problems1.cs file should give you some hints.

The objective of the second part of the assignment is to exercise your program design muscles. Open
up Problem2.cs and follow the instructions in the comments for each class. This exercise is particularly
open ended, so be creative.

Finally, in the last part of the assignment you will be finishing out a simple TicTacToe implementation
that I started. Take a look at the code inside the TicTacToe project and familiarize yourself with what's
going on. Then, implement the missing pieces in TicTacToeBoard.cs. You can identify these missing pieces
by looking for [````throws new NotImplementedException````] in the method and property bodies.
