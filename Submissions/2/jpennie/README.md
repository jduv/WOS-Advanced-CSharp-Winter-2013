Assignment 1
------------

First thing's first. Copy the contents of this directory to the following path (creating the appropriate
directories along the way):

C:\...\GitHub\WOS-Advanced-CSharp-Winter-2013\Submissions\2\yourName\

Please do not change the source code inside the root assignment directory. You should instead commit your own copy
into the submissions directory, and replace "yourName" above with a first initial then last name format.
For example, my submission would be located at:

C:\...\GitHub\WOS-Advanced-CSharp-Winter-2013\Submissions\1\jeremyd\

### Problem 1
There are three methods for you to implement inside the Problem1.cs class file. These should be pretty easy and
straightforward. Please read the comments and implement. There are tests in the test project that will tell you
when you have them implemented correctly.

### Problem 2
Implement a generic Stack and a Queue data structure. These data structures are very common. There are tests in
the test directory that will tell you when you have them implemented correctly. I strongly suggest that you use
a generic IList<> implementation for your internal representation of the elements, else you'll make things harder
on yourself when you have to keep up with the elements inside each data structure.
